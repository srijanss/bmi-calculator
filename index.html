          Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
          body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant
          of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate
          your overall health and well-being.

          <p>
            A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
            Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
            health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for
            a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
            ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
            physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a
            week.

          <p>
            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
            not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
            consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement
            may not be beneficial to use.
          </p>

            <h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>
            <p>
              The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
              with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered
              when evaluating their BMI.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section aria-labelledby="age">
            <h3 id="age">Age</h3>
            <p>
              In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause
              BMI to underestimate body fat content.
            </p>

          <section aria-labelledby="muscle">
            <h3 id="muscle">Muscle</h3>
            <p>
              BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese,
              as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.
            </p>

          <section aria-labelledby="pregnancy">
            <h3 id="pregnancy">Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>
              Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing
              baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to
              minimise health risks for both mother and child.

              Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and
              Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is
              advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
